 This repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks that are designed to be run individually in Google Colab. Each notebook is self-contained and includes instructions for loading the necessary utility files and datasets required for execution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run these notebooks, you'll need a Google account to access Google Colab. No installation is required on your local machine, as Google Colab provides a cloud-based environment with all the necessary Python libraries pre-installed.

### Running the Notebooks

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/annawoodcock/Dissertation.git

2. **Open Google Colab**: Visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account.

3. **Upload the Notebooks**: In Google Colab, use the `File > Upload notebook` option to upload any Jupyter notebook from this repository.

4. **Load Utility Files and Datasets**:
   - At the top of each notebook, there will be specific instructions on what utility files and datasets need to be loaded.
   - These files are located in the `UtilityFiles` folder and `datasets` folder within this repository.
   - You can upload these files to Colab by using the sidebar (`Files > Upload`) in your Colab session.
